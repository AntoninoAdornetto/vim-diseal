Packer plugin manager for neovim has been unmaintained since August of 2023. For that reason I have migrated to [Lazy Plugin Manager](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
and my new Neovim Configuration can be found at [vim-diesel-kickstart](https://github.com/AntoninoAdornetto/vim-diesel-kickstart)
